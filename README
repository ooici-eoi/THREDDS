Obtain the THREDDS project by running:
::
	git clone -b develop git@github.com:ooici-eoi/THREDDS.git


Pre-compilation
>>> Only need to do once or after modifications to base NetCDF component libraries
===============

From THREDDS directory:
1) mvn install
1a) IF you make changes to any of the core NetCDF libraries (in the 'cdm', 'opendap', 'bufr', 'common', or 'grib' directories) - they will only be discovered by the ooici-iosp codebase if you either:
	a) copy the libraries to the ooici/.settings/override-repo by running: "ant stage_netcdf_deps" from the THREDDS directory
		**Note that if you use this method, you will need to run "ant unstage_netcdf_deps" in order to switch back to getting the core dependencies from the remote server
	b) copy the new core libraries to the root level of the ooici.net release server so they are available for the ooici-iosp codebase
		** After the new libraries are available on the server, run "ant resolve" from the THREDDS/ooici/ directory to update the local workspace
2) ant -f cdm/build.xml ooiciMakeUI
